## 2026-10-04: Production build type check

- **Error:** `app/(admin)/layout.tsx` typed its props as `LayoutProps<"/admin">`, but Next.js 16.3.8 generates `LayoutProps` route types for layouts only. `/admin` is a page route in this app, and its parent admin layout lives in the `(admin)` route group, so the generated `LayoutRoutes` union contains `/` but not `/admin`.
- **Fix:** Type the route-group layout's only prop directly as `{ children: React.ReactNode }`. Keep route-aware `LayoutProps` for layouts whose URL route is represented in the generated layout route types.
- **Prevention:** When using Next.js route-aware helpers, check the generated `.next/types/routes.d.ts` and the installed Next.js documentation for this version. Route groups do not add URL segments and may not produce an independently typed route path.
- **Verification:** `npm.cmd run build` completed successfully after the fix, including compilation, TypeScript checking, static page generation, and optimization.
