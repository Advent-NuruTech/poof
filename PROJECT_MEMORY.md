Record verified errors and fixes, plus major changes, here. Review this file before related work to avoid repeating known issues in future versions.

## 2026-10-04: Production build type check

- **Error:** `app/(admin)/layout.tsx` typed its props as `LayoutProps<"/admin">`, but Next.js 16.3.8 generates `LayoutProps` route types for layouts only. `/admin` is a page route in this app, and its parent admin layout lives in the `(admin)` route group, so the generated `LayoutRoutes` union contains `/` but not `/admin`.
- **Fix:** Type the route-group layout's only prop directly as `{ children: React.ReactNode }`. Keep route-aware `LayoutProps` for layouts whose URL route is represented in the generated layout route types.
- **Prevention:** When using Next.js route-aware helpers, check the generated `.next/types/routes.d.ts` and the installed Next.js documentation for this version. Route groups do not add URL segments and may not produce an independently typed route path.
- **Verification:** `npm.cmd run build` completed successfully after the fix, including compilation, TypeScript checking, static page generation, and optimization.

## 2026-10-04: Playlist pages and latest videos

- **Major changes:** Added `/playlists` as a directory of visible playlists and `/playlists/[id]` as a shareable playlist detail page. Playlist detail loads each referenced video document so the full ordered playlist is shown even when those videos are outside the latest-videos list; unavailable records still link to YouTube. Home playlist and past-meeting cards now open the detail route.
- **Major changes:** Removed Firestore `orderBy("publishedAt")` from the latest videos listener. Ordering is already performed client-side, so the server-side ordering was redundant and could make the listener require an unconfigured composite index. Raised the listener cap from 40 to 300 before client sorting.
- **Errors and fixes:** No build/runtime errors encountered during this change.
- **Verification:** `npm.cmd run build` completed successfully, including TypeScript checks and generation of `/playlists` and `/playlists/[id]`.

## 2026-10-04: Featured playlist sizing and hero rotation

- **Major changes:** Featured playlist cards now use larger fixed-width cards in a horizontally scrollable, snap-aligned mobile row, showing at most a few cards at once while keeping the rest accessible by scrolling.
- **Major changes:** Hero content rotates every five seconds when multiple videos are available. Hero height is now content-driven with a responsive minimum, so long titles or descriptions can expand the section rather than being clipped by a fixed maximum height.
- **Errors and fixes:** No build/runtime errors encountered.
- **Verification:** `npm.cmd run build` completed successfully, including TypeScript checks and page generation.
